1. training and testing split (model selection only on training set)
2. fit M on training set 
3. predict on the test set 
4. calculate the test error 



Cross Validation 
1. 5-fold cv
2. for i = 1 to 5 
	Gi as the validation set 
	Gi/neqj as the training set
	validation error rate ei
3. cv error raten: e = 1/5 * \sum_1^5 e_i 




avoid overfitting
